        <div class="subheading mb-5">Public Policy ౨ৎ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a dedicated and compassionate individual with a passion for healthcare, I am currently pursuing a degree in Public Policy at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) with the ultimate goal of becoming a Nurse Anesthetist. My journey into the world of healthcare began with a profound desire to make a meaningful impact on the lives of others, and my academic and professional experiences reflect this commitment. At UCR, I have immersed myself in the rigorous and intellectually stimulating environment of the Public Policy program. This major has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the intricate dynamics shaping our healthcare system, from policy formulation to implementation. The interdisciplinary nature of my studies has equipped me with a well-rounded perspective, honing my analytical and problem-solving skills essential for navigating the complexities of the healthcare landscape. Complementing my academic pursuits, I have actively sought opportunities to engage directly with the healthcare community.<br><br>

        Volunteering at Torrance Memorial Medical Center has been a transformative experience, allowing me to witness the real-world application of public policies and their impact on patient care. From interacting with patients to supporting medical staff, this hands-on involvement has deepened my appreciation for the intricacies of healthcare delivery and reinforced my commitment to pursuing a career that directly contributes to patient well-being. In addition to my hospital volunteering, I have gained valuable insights into the needs of the elderly population through my employment at a local retirement home. Working closely with seniors has provided me with a unique perspective on the challenges they face in accessing quality healthcare. This experience has underscored the importance of compassionate and patient-centered care, solidifying my determination to contribute to the field as a healthcare professional. <br><br>

        My decision to transition from Public Policy to a career as a Nurse Anesthetist stems from a desire to merge my passion for healthcare advocacy with hands-on patient care. Recognizing the critical role that anesthesia plays in surgical procedures, I am committed to ensuring the highest standard of care for patients undergoing these interventions. Pursuing this advanced nursing specialty aligns perfectly with my overarching goal of making a positive impact on the healthcare system.
Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I am an individual deeply committed to personal growth and community engagement. Whether through involvement in campus organizations or participating in community service initiatives, I strive to contribute positively to the environments in which I find myself. I believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork, values that I have cultivated through both my academic and professional experiences. As I continue my academic journey and work towards becoming a Nurse Anesthetist, I am excited about the opportunities for learning and growth that lie ahead. My experiences in public policy, volunteering at Torrance Memorial Medical Center, and working in a retirement home have laid a solid foundation for my future endeavors. I am confident that my unique blend of skills, passion for healthcare, and commitment to advocacy will position me as a dedicated and effective healthcare professional.
